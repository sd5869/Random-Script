This is the main file which we need to run to Generate Testcases.We need to provide all details like: number of files to produce, number of testcases in each file etc.

##ANS.py
This file contains the solution code which we need to add incase we need the output file. There is space provided in the between which we need to add the solution. note, that we need to use ip.readline() funtion istead of input and op.write() instead of print we also need to takecare of writing newline at the end.We also need to remove newline from the string we read.See Examples for details.
